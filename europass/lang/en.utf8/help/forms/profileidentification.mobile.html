<h3>Mobile</h3>
Write your mobile phone number, using the same rules as for your fixed-line telephone number(s) e.g.:   <blockquote>    6945 120 30 46 </blockquote>   <p><strong>NB:</strong>  </p> <li> 	If you wish to send your CV to other countries, give the country prefix and any regional prefix in brackets. These two prefixes should be joined by a hyphen, e.g.: (44-20) 80 12 34 56 for a number in London. </li>     <li> 	Divide the principal number into groups of two from the right-hand side, the last group consisting of three digits if the number is odd (groups are separated by a space, not by a full stop), e.g. (353-1) 220 20 20 for a number in Dublin. </li>

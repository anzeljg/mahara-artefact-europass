<h3>Telephone(s)</h3>
State the telephone number(s) where you wish to be contacted;<br/>if necessary, give specific days and times when it is possible to reach you (so that you can be contacted quickly), e.g.: <blockquote>0845 120 30 45 </blockquote><p><strong>NB:</strong> </p><li>If you wish to send your CV to other countries, give the country prefix and any regional prefix in brackets. These two prefixes should be joined by a hyphen, e.g.: (44-20) 80 12 34 56 for a number in London. </li><li>Divide the principal number into groups of two from the right-hand side, the last group consisting of three digits if the number is odd (groups are separated by a space, not by a full stop), e.g. (353-1) 220 20 20 for a number in Dublin. </li>
